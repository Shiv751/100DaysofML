# 100 Days of ML Challenge 

## Day 1 : July 5, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I picked up the Boston House Pricing dataset for implementing Linear Regression. 
* **Thoughts**: I chose this dataset just as a warmup.

## Day 2 : July 6, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: After learning the basics of Keras, I implemented Sequential model on Breast Cancer Dataset available in scikit-learn.
* **Thoughts**: I am currently enrolled in a course, so this Keras lecture is a part of the course.

## Day 3 : July 7, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I built a Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow to classify the images in MNIST dataset. This dataset has images of handwritten digits. The model runs at an accuracy of 98%.

## Day 4 : July 8, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: Improved the code done yesterday by building a Convolutional Neural Network in Keras to classify the images in MNIST dataset. The accuracy of the model is 99.4%.

## Day 5 : July 9, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I used the Cifar10 dataset on the Convolutional Neural Network built using Keras. Cifar10 dataset has images which belong to one of the 10 classes like bird, truck, cat, frog, etc. The accuracy is 77.4%;
