# 100 Days of ML Challenge 

## Day 1 : July 5, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I picked up the Boston House Pricing dataset for implementing Linear Regression. 
* **Thoughts**: I chose this dataset just as a warmup.

## Day 2 : July 6, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: After learning the basics of Keras, I implemented Sequential model on Breast Cancer Dataset available in scikit-learn.
* **Thoughts**: I am currently enrolled in a course, so this Keras lecture is a part of the course.

## Day 3 : July 7, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I built a Convolutional Neural Network in Tensorflow to classify the images in MNIST dataset. This dataset has images of handwritten digits. The model runs at an accuracy of 98%.

## Day 4 : July 8, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: Improved the code done yesterday by building a Convolutional Neural Network in Keras to classify the images in MNIST dataset. The accuracy of the model is 99.4%.

## Day 5 : July 9, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I used the Cifar10 dataset on the Convolutional Neural Network built using Keras. Cifar10 dataset has images which belong to one of the 10 classes like bird, truck, cat, frog, etc.

## Day 6 : July 10, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I learnt RNN, which is a part of the course. So, I built a network containing SimpleRNN layer, in order to understand the whole working. The dataset used is International-Airline-Passengers.

## Day 7 : July 11, 2018

* **Today's Progress**: I implemented Naive Bayes classifier from scratch, and used it for predicting the classes in Iris Dataset available in Scikit-learn.
